# # Modules is like a code which can be used to borrow the code written by someone else in our python program. There
# are two types of modules in python

# 1) Build in Module : These modules are ready to import and use and ships with the python interrupter. There is no
# need to install such module explicitly

# 2) External Module : These modules are imported from a third party  file or can be installed using a package
# manager like pip or conda. Since this code is written by someone else, we can install different version of a same
# module with time.


# The pip command it can be used as a package manager pip to install a python module. Let's install a module called
# pandas using the following command

# pip install pandas

import pandas

pandas.read_csv('words.csv')

# Similarly we can install other module and look into their documentation for use instruction.
# We will find ourselves doing this often in the later part of this course
